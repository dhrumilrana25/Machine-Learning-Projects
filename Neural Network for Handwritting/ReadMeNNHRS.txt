Developing a complete neural network for handwriting recognition from scratch would require a significant amount of code and is beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can outline the high-level steps and provide a simple example using Python and popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

For handwriting recognition, we'll use a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of neural network well-suited for image processing tasks like character recognition.

Here are the steps:

Data Collection: Gather a labeled dataset of handwritten characters or digits. A popular dataset for this task is the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset to normalize the images and prepare them for training. Common preprocessing steps include resizing, normalizing pixel values, and converting labels to one-hot encoded vectors.

Build the CNN: Define the architecture of the convolutional neural network. A simple CNN typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Compile the Model: Choose an appropriate loss function (categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification), an optimizer (e.g., Adam), and any additional performance metrics.

Train the Model: Feed the preprocessed data into the network and train it on the handwritten images.

Evaluate the Model: Test the trained model on a separate test set to assess its performance.

Handwriting Recognition: Use the trained model to predict handwritten characters.
