This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris
flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised
ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit
in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities

To create an Iris flower classifier using machine learning, follow these steps:

Data Collection: Obtain the Iris dataset, which includes features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) of Iris flowers and their corresponding species labels (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

Data Preprocessing: Check for missing values and normalize the features if necessary.

Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%).

Model Selection and Training: Choose a machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Train the model using the training set.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can be used.

Deployment: Once the model performs well, deploy it as an Iris flower classifier.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their features.

By following these steps, you can create a simple and effective Iris flower classifier using machine learning. Make sure to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best-performing model for the dataset.
